"Drupal 7 Development Core Concepts" Video Series Resource Pack
===================================================

This is the collection of files that are used in the "Drupal 7 Development Core Concepts" video collection on [BuildAModule](http://buildamodule.com). In this collection we go over some of the most important concepts and APIs to know when working with Drupal code. Throughout the series, we:

* Create several example modules
* Learn how to build and alter forms
* Learn how to work with users programmatically
* Explore how to include CSS and JavaScript files
* Nail down the basics of jQuery

Many of the files here use a custom '.step' extension, which are referred to as 'step files'. This convention allows you to open all of the files in the editor of your choice, allows us to make hidden files visible, and makes it clear that the name of the step file is not the name of the final file that you will be using.

Enjoy!
